### **1. Introduction**

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable fluency in machine translation and various natural language processing fields by statistically mapping and recognizing patterns from vast amounts of linguistic data. However, current LLM-based systems often fall short in capturing the deep semantic nuances, cultural implications, and speaker's cognitive perspectives inherent in human language. This often leads to "translationese," culturally inappropriate translations, and sometimes even 'hallucinations' that deviate from factual information.

This specification introduces **CogniCore Language (CCL)**, a new paradigm designed to overcome these limitations of LLMs and advance language intelligence to the next level. CCL is a **language-independent Conceptual Intermediate Representation (CIR)** based on the principles of human Cognitive Grammar. It is designed to explicitly encode the deep meaning of all natural language texts, enabling LLMs to cognize, reason, and generate language independently of its surface form.

CCL transcends being merely a translation tool. It transforms the role of LLMs from direct surface mappers into **'cognitive reconceptualizers,'** allowing for a more robust conveyance of meaning, intention, and cultural context. The introduction of CCL is expected to maximize the computational efficiency of LLMs, enhance the accuracy and controllability of their output, and ultimately significantly reduce 'hallucination' phenomena.

We commit to releasing CCL to the global community under the MIT License, allowing anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute it. This aims to foster a vibrant open-source ecosystem around CCL and contribute to the future of LLM research and development.

### **2. Theoretical Foundation: Cognitive Grammar**

CCL is deeply rooted in Ronald Langacker's **Cognitive Grammar (CG)** theory. Cognitive Grammar views language as a product of 'conceptualization,' based on human cognitive abilities and experience. That is, language does not merely reflect objective reality but rather represents how a speaker understands, structures, and expresses the world from a particular perspective. This cognitive perspective provides crucial insights necessary for LLMs to 'understand' and 'reconstruct' deep semantic structures beyond the surface forms of language.

CCL adopts Cognitive Grammar as its core theoretical foundation for the following reasons:

* **Mimicry of Human Cognition**: It emphasizes that the meaning of language is not merely an arbitrary combination of symbols, but a conceptual structure formed through human cognitive processes. This helps LLMs more closely mimic human language processing.
* **Capture of Subtle Nuances**: It provides a framework for capturing and structuring linguistic phenomena often missed by conventional LLMs, such as metaphors, emotions, and cultural implications, from a cognitive perspective.
* **Enhanced Explainability**: A Conceptual Intermediate Representation (CIR) based on Cognitive Grammar principles can partially expose the internal reasoning processes of LLMs, potentially increasing the explainability of 'black box' models.

CCL directly integrates key concepts of Cognitive Grammar into its schemas and parameters to express the deep meaning of language.

* **Image Schemas**: Universal and abstract cognitive structures derived from human bodily experience, forming the foundation of linguistic expressions (e.g., CONTAINER, PATH, FORCE, UP-DOWN schemas).
* **Profiling and Perspective**: Addresses how, even for the same event or concept, the speaker 'profiles' certain aspects (parts) and relegates others to the background, and how the speaker's 'perspective' (e.g., active/passive voice, close-up/distant viewpoint) is reflected.
* **Force Dynamics**: A schema representing the relationship of interacting forces between two or more entities (e.g., resistance, propulsion, permission, compulsion) and the resulting change in state. It is crucial for understanding causality and state changes.

### **3. CogniCore Language (CCL) Specification**

CCL is a systematic collection of **Conceptual Intermediate Representations (CIR)**, which are language-independent meaning expressions that go beyond the surface form of language. It is based on how humans cognize and conceptualize the world, and unlike traditional interlinguas that primarily focus on logical/propositional meaning, CCL emphasizes **embodied meaning construction based on human experience**.

CCL encodes the core cognitive elements of all natural language texts in the form of **'Semantic Blocks.'** Each semantic block is enclosed in square brackets `[]` and uses a colon `:` to follow the structure: `SCHEMA_TOKEN: [parameter_name: value, ...]`.

    * **Example**: `[INTENT: type="INCITE", rhetorical_strategy="APPEAL_TO_EMOTION", speaker_role="anonymous", target_audience="public"]`

#### **3.2. CCL Grammar & Syntax**

CCL has a hierarchical and modular structure, with each semantic block adhering to clear grammatical rules.

* **Basic Structure**: All CCL expressions consist of one or more semantic blocks.
    `[SCHEMA_TOKEN: parameter_name="value", parameter_name="value", ...]`
* **Schema Token**: An uppercase schema name (e.g., `CONTAINER`, `FORCE_DYNAMICS`, `ENTITY`).
* **Parameters**: Attributes that specify meaning within each schema. Expressed as `parameter_name="value"`. Values can be strings, numbers, or IDs of other CCL blocks.
* **Nesting**: Other CCL semantic blocks can be nested as parameter values. This is used to express complex conceptual relationships.
    * **Example**: `[CONTAINER: enclosed_entity="[ENTITY: type="idea", id="idea_X"]", container_entity="[ENTITY: type="mind", id="mind_Y"]"]`
* **Unique ID Assignment**: Especially for `ENTITY` and `EVENT` blocks that can be repeatedly referenced, unique `id`s are assigned to allow other blocks to refer to them. This is essential for tracking entities and forming relationships within the text.
    * **Example**: `[ENTITY: type="HUMAN", id="JOHN_1"]` -> `[ACTION: type="TALK", agent="JOHN_1"]`
* **Connectors**: Used to explicitly indicate relationships between multiple semantic blocks.
    * `AND`: Two blocks exist simultaneously or are in a parallel relationship.
        * **Example**: `[ACTION: "walk"] AND [LOCATION: "park"]`
    * `BUT`: A contrasting relationship between two blocks.
        * **Example**: `[EMOTION: "happy"] BUT [ACTION: "cry"]`
    * `->` (RESULT/CAUSATION): The preceding block is the result or cause of the following block.
        * **Example**: `[CAUSE: "rain"] -> [EFFECT: "wet_ground"]`
    * `|` (OR): Either one or both of the two blocks are possible.
        * **Example**: `[TIME: "morning"] | [TIME: "evening"]`
* **Segmentation**: Each sentence or meaningful unit of the source text can be converted into a sequence of separate CCL blocks, which can be separated by delimiters such as `---`.

#### **3.3. CCL Expression Examples (Practical Examples)**

This section provides concrete examples of how various natural language expressions are encoded into CCL, which is key to understanding CCL's expressive power and usage.

##### **Example 1: Simple Sentences & Basic Concepts**

* **Source (Korean)**: "나는 방에 있다." (I am in the room.)
* **CCL Encoding**:
    ```
    [EVENT: type="BE_LOCATED",
        trajector="[ENTITY: type="HUMAN", id="SPEAKER_1"]",
        landmark="[ENTITY: type="SPACE", id="ROOM_1", properties="enclosed"]",
        relation="[CONTAINER: relationship="INTERNAL", enclosed_entity="SPEAKER_1", container_entity="ROOM_1"]",
        time="[TIME: tense="PRESENT"]",
        perspective="[PROFILING_PERSPECTIVE: perspective_type="INTERNAL"]"
    ]
    ```
    * **Explanation**: Expresses that the speaker (`SPEAKER_1`) is located (`BE_LOCATED`) inside a specific space (`ROOM_1`), at the present time (`PRESENT`), perceived from the speaker's internal perspective (`INTERNAL`).

* **Source (Korean)**: "새가 날아갔다." (A bird flew away.)
* **CCL Encoding**:
    ```
    [PATH:
        trajector_entity="[ENTITY: type="ANIMAL", id="BIRD_1"]",
        motion_type="PHYSICAL",
        direction="AWAY_FROM_OBSERVER",
        time="[TIME: tense="PAST", aspect="PERFECTIVE"]"
    ]
    ```
    * **Explanation**: Indicates a physical (`PHYSICAL`) act of flying (`PATH`) by a bird (`BIRD_1`) in the past tense (`PAST`), moving away from the observer (`AWAY_FROM_OBSERVER`).

##### **Example 2: Emotion and Metaphorical Expressions**

* **Source (Korean)**: "내 피는 차갑게 식었다." (My blood ran cold.)
* **CCL Encoding**:
    ```
    [EMOTION:
        emotion_type="INTENSE_FEAR_HORROR_PARANOIA",
        intensity="INTENSE",
        experiencer="[ENTITY: type="HUMAN", id="NARRATOR_1"]"
    ]
    AND [FORCE_DYNAMICS:
        agent_of_force="[ENTITY: type="ABSTRACT", id="EXTERNAL_THREAT"]", // Potential threat
        patient_of_force="[ENTITY: type="CONCEPT", id="NARRATOR_CALM_STATE"]", // Narrator's calm state
        force_type="COMPULSION",
        result_state="[QUALIFICATION: entity_id="NARRATOR_1", attribute="physical_sensation", value="cold", degree="STRONG"]"
    ]
    AND [SCHEMA_EXTENSION:
        source_schema="[QUALIFICATION: attribute="temperature"]",
        target_concept="[EMOTION: type="fear"]",
        connection_type="METAPHORICAL"
    ]
    ```
    * **Explanation**: Indicates that the narrator (`NARRATOR_1`) experiences intense fear (`INTENSE_FEAR_HORROR_PARANOIA`). Simultaneously, it metaphorically expresses a `FORCE_DYNAMICS` where an external force (`EXTERNAL_THREAT`) compels a change in the narrator's calm state (`NARRATOR_CALM_STATE`), resulting in a strong physical sensation of coldness. Finally, it explicitly notes a `METAPHORICAL` connection where temperature change extends to emotion.

##### **Example 3: Honorifics & Speaker-Hearer Relationship**

* **Source (Korean)**: "수고하셨습니다." (You worked hard / Well done. - To a superior)
* **CCL Encoding**:
    ```
    [ACTION:
        type="VERBAL_COMMUNICATION",
        agent="[ENTITY: type="HUMAN", id="SPEAKER_1"]",
        patient="[ENTITY: type="HUMAN", id="HEARER_1"]",
        content="[ACTION: type="PERFORM_TASK", agent="HEARER_1", outcome="COMPLETION", effort="HIGH"]"
    ]
    AND [SUBJECTIFICATION:
        speaker_stance="RESPECTFUL_FORMAL",
        hearer_status_relation="HIGHER_OR_EQUAL_RESPECT_REQUIRED",
        speaker_intention="EXPRESS_APPRECIATION_FORMAL"
    ]
    ```
    * **Explanation**: The speaker (`SPEAKER_1`) performs a verbal act (`VERBAL_COMMUNICATION`) towards the hearer (`HEARER_1`), the content of which is about the hearer completing a task (`PERFORM_TASK`) with high effort. The `SUBJECTIFICATION` schema explicitly indicates the speaker's respectful and formal stance, recognition of the hearer's higher status or requiring respect, and the intention to express formal appreciation.

##### **Example 4: Idioms and Cultural Context**

* **Source (Korean)**: "식은 죽 먹기." (Eating cold porridge. - Meaning: Very easy task)
* **CCL Encoding**:
    ```
    [CULTURAL_MAPPING_POINT:
        cultural_concept_id="KOREAN_IDIOM_COLD_PORRIDGE_EATING",
        type="IDIOM",
        language_origin="Korean",
        context_details="simplicity/ease_of_task"
    ]
    AND [QUALIFICATION:
        entity_id="[ENTITY: type="TASK", id="TASK_X"]", // Refers to the task
        attribute="difficulty",
        value="EASY",
        degree="EXTREMELY"
    ]
    ```
    * **Explanation**: Explicitly notes that this is a Korean-specific idiom (`KOREAN_IDIOM_COLD_PORRIDGE_EATING`). It then encodes that the difficulty of the implied task (`TASK_X`) is extremely easy (`EXTREMELY EASY`). CCL encodes the **abstract meaning and cultural context** inherent in the idiom, rather than merely translating the literal phrase.

#### **3.4. CCL Data Types & Validation**

CCL supports basic data types to ensure the validity of parameter values.

* **String**: Values enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"physical"`, `"book"`).
* **Boolean**: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
* **Number**: Integers or floating-point numbers.
* **Enum (Enumerated Type)**: Selected from a predefined set of specific values (e.g., `HUMAN/OBJECT/CONCEPT` for the `type` parameter). These are specified in the parameter definitions within the specification.
* **ID Reference**: Refers to the unique `id` values of other CCL blocks (e.g., `entity_id="NARRATOR"`). This explicitly links relationships between blocks.

Validation of CCL expressions adheres to the following rules:

* All schema tokens must be in the defined list of CCL schemas.
* All parameters must be in the defined list of parameters for their respective schema.
* Parameter values must conform to their defined data types and enumerated values.
* Nested CCL blocks must comply with proper CCL syntax.
* `id` references must refer to an existing block with that ID within the scope of the CCL expression.

### **4. CCL-Based LLM Architecture and Application**

CCL is designed to transform existing LLM architectures into 'cognitive reconceptualizers,' revolutionizing the efficiency and accuracy of language processing. The proposed CCL-based LLM system primarily involves two stages of processing.

#### **4.1. Two-Phase LLM Architecture**

The CCL-based LLM system operates with two main components:

1.  **CCL Encoder (Encoder LLM)**:
    * **Role**: Takes source language text as input and **converts it into a CCL (CIR) representation.**
    * **Input**: Any natural language text (e.g., Korean, English, Chinese, etc.).
    * **Output**: A sequence of CCL-formatted strings encoding the deep meaning of the input text.
    * **Training Goal**: Aims to accurately capture all cognitive, semantic, and cultural nuances of the source text and transform them into CCL without loss.
2.  **CCL Decoder (Decoder LLM)**:
    * **Role**: Takes a CCL (CIR) representation as input and **generates target language text from it.**
    * **Input**: A sequence of CCL-formatted strings.
    * **Output**: Natural and accurate target language text that expresses the conceptual meaning encoded in CCL.
    * **Training Goal**: Aims to generate the most natural and appropriate text based on the conceptual meaning embedded in CCL, considering the grammar, style, and cultural characteristics of the target language.

This two-phase architecture shifts the role of LLMs from direct language-to-language mapping to a **language-independent conceptual thinking stage**. The encoder and decoder can be distinct LLM models or different fine-tuned versions of the same model.

#### **4.2. Training Methodology (Conceptual Proposal)**

The core of training a CCL-based LLM system is building high-quality CCL-natural language paired datasets. The approach proposed in the paper is as follows:

1.  **Construction of Small-Scale Expert-Annotated Dataset**:
    * A small group of highly skilled linguists and cognitive science experts manually annotate selected natural language texts into CCL. This provides 'gold standard' data for initial model training.
2.  **Large-Scale Dataset Automatic Generation (with LLM & Human Review)**:
    * Use the initially trained CCL Encoder to automatically convert large volumes of natural language text into CCL.
    * Automatically generated CCL data is then reverse-converted back into natural language text by the CCL Decoder and compared with the original text (Round-trip consistency check).
    * Human reviewers inspect the quality of these automatically generated CCL-natural language pairs and correct errors.
    * This process efficiently builds a vast amount of high-quality CCL-natural language parallel datasets.
3.  **Multi-task Learning and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) Potential**:
    * Encoder and decoder models can be trained on various language pairs, not just single-language translation, to enhance CCL's universality.
    * Human feedback on the 'cognitive validity' of the generated CCL representations and the 'naturalness' of the final text can be leveraged through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to continuously improve model performance.

---

### **5. Expected Outcomes & Benefits of CCL**

A CCL-based LLM system is expected to revolutionize machine translation and general LLM language processing capabilities in the following ways:

* **Enhanced Translation Quality and Naturalness**:
    * **Cultural Nuance and Emotion Transfer**: Through CCL's [SUBJECTIFICATION] and [CULTURAL_MAPPING_POINT] schemas, the cultural implications, honorifics/politeness, and subtle emotional tones of the source text will be reflected more naturally and accurately in the target language. This will address the problem of 'translationese' and significantly improve the 'naturalness' of translation outputs.
    * **Idiom and Metaphor Translation**: CCL encodes the cognitive/cultural essence of idioms and metaphors, rather than their literal surface meaning, allowing for translation into the most appropriate idioms or metaphors in the target language.
* **Mitigation of Hallucination and Semantic Errors**:
    * CCL eliminates linguistic ambiguity by explicitly structuring core meanings. This fundamentally reduces 'hallucination' phenomena where LLMs 'make up' information or distort the original meaning. LLMs will operate strictly within the semantic boundaries encoded by CCL.
* **Improved Explainability and Controllability**:
    * CCL explicitly reveals, through an intermediate representation, what conceptual understanding has occurred within the LLM's 'black box.' This greatly aids in understanding and debugging the LLM's reasoning process.
    * Developers and users can directly modify CCL to precisely control the meaning, tone, style, and perspective of the text generated by the LLM. For example, changing the 'intensity' or 'speaker's attitude' within CCL can prompt the LLM to generate new sentences reflecting these changes.
* **Cross-Lingual Generalization and Multilingual Support**:
    * CCL's language-independent nature reduces dependence on specific language pairs. A single CCL encoder can process multiple source languages, and a single CCL decoder can generate multiple target languages.
    * This also has the potential to improve LLM performance for low-resource languages.
* **Extension to Various LLM Applications**:
    * Beyond simple machine translation, CCL can play a pivotal role in a wide range of LLM-based applications, including text summarization, question answering, sentiment analysis, content generation, and even conceptual communication between humans and AI.

### **6. Challenges & Future Roadmap**

The ultimate realization of CCL and its widespread adoption face the following challenges, which will be central to future research and development roadmaps:

* **Deepening CCL Definition and Standardization**:
    * This specification presents an initial version of CCL. To fully capture the complexity of human language, further refinement and standardization of additional schemas, parameters, and grammatical rules are necessary. This will require continuous collaboration across cognitive science, linguistics, and computational linguistics.
* **Building Large-Scale, High-Quality CCL Datasets**:
    * A massive amount of 'natural language-CCL' parallel datasets is essential for effectively training CCL-based LLMs. Research is needed to maximize the efficiency of the automatic generation and human review methods proposed in the paper.
* **Optimizing Model Complexity and Efficiency**:
    * Research is required to optimize the architecture of CCL encoder and decoder models to enhance training and inference efficiency. Managing computational costs, especially when integrating CCL with large-scale LLMs, is crucial.
* **Developing Evaluation Metrics**:
    * New evaluation metrics are needed to quantitatively assess CCL's performance. Beyond existing translation quality metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, etc.), metrics capable of evaluating 'cognitive validity,' 'meaning preservation,' and 'cultural appropriateness' are required.
* **Community and Tool Development**:
    * For CCL to spread, a strong developer community is essential, along with the development of ecosystem support tools such as CCL parsing/generation tools, visualization tools, and debugging tools.
* **Extension to Multimodality**:
    * In the long term, CCL can be extended to cognitive representations of other modalities such as vision and hearing, aiming for a more comprehensive understanding of artificial intelligence.

### **7. Conclusion**

CogniCore Language (CCL) proposes a new standard that guides Large Language Models to understand and generate the deep cognitive dimensions of human language. As a language-independent Conceptual Intermediate Representation based on Cognitive Grammar principles, CCL has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency, accuracy, controllability, and explainability of LLMs.

Despite existing challenges, CCL represents a crucial first step in opening new horizons for the future of machine translation and general LLM applications through interdisciplinary collaboration in computational linguistics, cognitive science, and AI research. Ultimately, our goal is for LLMs to evolve beyond mere 'language translation machines' into 'intelligence that understands and communicates concepts'.
