### **ðŸ“˜ Technical Specification: High-Efficiency Communication Protocol**

**Document ID:** `HCP-SPEC-Rev1-COMPLETE`
**Status:** Standard
**Core Philosophy:** **The clear and efficient expression of structured meaning.** This document is a self-contained, complete standard that defines all rules for data communication between systems. The goal of this protocol is to translate complex real-world phenomena and internal thought processes into 49 standard data structures that can be processed by machines without error.

---

#### **1. Overview**

This document defines the technical standard for a protocol designed for data communication between systems. The protocol aims to represent various types of information clearly and efficiently, enabling machines to interpret and process it without ambiguity. This specification includes all grammar, data types, and rules of the protocol, requiring no external references for implementation.

#### **2. Basic Syntax and Structure**

*   **Data Structure:** Every unit of information is enclosed in parentheses `()`, with the first element being the data type code, followed by the required data values for that type listed in a **predefined order**.
    *   **Format:** `(DataType_Code, value1, value2, value3, ...)`
*   **Reference Operator:** To reference another data object, prefix the value with the `@` symbol.
    *   **Example:** `@Object[ID]`, `@Role[Name]`
*   **Logical Connectors:** Logical relationships between data structures (e.g., cause-effect, co-occurrence) are expressed with symbols such as `->`, `~>`, and `&`.
*   **Metadata:** To attach supplementary information (e.g., timestamp, source), use a semicolon `;` at the end of the data structure.
    *   **Format:** `(...);(MetaKey1:Value1, MetaKey2:Value2)`

#### **3. Data Type Definitions (49 Total)**

The protocol defines a total of 49 data types. Each data type has a unique code in the format `T#`.

#### **4. Communication Example**

**Situation:** "An e-commerce AI assesses that a VIP customer is at high risk of churning after a recent negative service experience. To align with the core business value of 'customer retention', the AI decides to proactively send a personalized discount offer."

**Serialized Protocol String:**
```hcp
(T44, @T1[crm_ai], @T1[user_451], customer_churn, 0.85, high, @T41[feedback_99])
~> (T39, @T1[crm_ai], [send_offer, wait], (@T46, @T39, customer_retention, 0.95), send_offer)
-> (T29, @T1[crm_ai], @T1[user_451], proactive_outreach, email, @T1[offer_xyz])
```

**Interpretation:**
1.  `(T44, ...)`: `Risk Assessment` data. The AI assesses a specific user's churn risk, linking its cause to a negative feedback event.
2.  `~>`: 'Triggers' connector. The risk assessment triggers the subsequent decision.
3.  `(T39, ...)`: `Decision Point` data. The AI uses `Value Alignment (T46)` with 'customer retention' as the core criterion to select the 'send offer' action.
4.  `->`: 'Direct Cause' connector. The decision directly causes the actual action.
5.  `(T29, ...)`: `Communication Act` data. Describes the final action of the AI sending an email with the offer to the user.
