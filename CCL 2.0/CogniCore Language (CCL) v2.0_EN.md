### **[CogniCore Language (CCL) v2.0: The Final Optimized Specification]**

---

This document defines the **Universal Cognitive Communication Protocol (CCL)**, designed for all intelligent agents (human and AI) to **share intent and logic with clarity and efficiency**.

**Core Principle**: This protocol defines the **universal cognitive patterns** underlying the thought processes of all intelligent beings into **12 Core Schemas**. These are interconnected by **4 Core Protocols and 4 Core Connectors** to maximize executional efficiency without sacrificing semantic meaning. This language is model-agnostic and origin-independent, with the primary goals of ensuring **Transparency** and **Economy** in all communications.

### **1. Principle 1: "The Best" - The 12 Core Cognitive Schemas**

To achieve completeness in semantic representation, each schema includes a core attribute to capture subtle nuances.

*   **[CONTAINMENT: concept="", inside_of="", includes="", boundary_permeability=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Inclusion, categorization, and domain relationships.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `boundary_permeability` - The degree of openness/closedness of the boundary.
*   **[JOURNEY: type="", source="", destination="", progression_details="", phase="", emotional_trajectory=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Movement, change, and the flow of time.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `emotional_trajectory` - The emotional arc of the process.
*   **[BALANCE: state="", elements="", relationship="", focus="", resolution_potential=""]**
    *   **Concept**: States of equilibrium, opposition, or harmony.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `resolution_potential` - The future direction of the state.
*   **[CONNECTION: type="", element_a="", element_b="", strength="", nature="", cultural_context=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Links, relationships, and interactions.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `cultural_context` - The cultural background influencing the relationship.
*   **[FORCE: type="", agent="", target="", intensity="", effect="", direction="", perceived_legitimacy=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Influence, pressure, and drivers of change.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `perceived_legitimacy` - The perceived justification of the force.
*   **[BARRIER: type="", obstacle="", prevents="", overcome_potential="", source_of_barrier=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Obstacles, resistance, and limitations.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `source_of_barrier` - Whether the obstacle is internal or external.
*   **[CYCLE: type="", event="", frequency="", consequence="", emotional_impact=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Cycles, repetitions, and patterns.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `emotional_impact` - The emotion induced by the repetition.
*   **[OPENNESS: type="", entity="", exposed_to="", degree="", consequence="", intentionality=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Openness, transparency, and vulnerability.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `intentionality` - Whether the openness is intentional or unintentional.
*   **[IDENTITY: type="", entity="", definition="", distinguishing_features="", relationship_to="", evolving_state=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Identity, essence, and role.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `evolving_state` - The potential for the identity to change.
*   **[DIFFERENCE: type="", element_a="", element_b="", basis="", significance="", implied_meaning=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Difference, contrast, and distinction.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `implied_meaning` - What the difference implies.
*   [**COMPLEMENT: type="", element_a="", element_b="", contributes_to="", nature="", completeness_degree=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Complementation, completion, and integration.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `completeness_degree` - How complete the whole becomes through complementation.
*   **[GROUND: type="", concept="", underlying_principle="", evidence="", context="", perceived_truthfulness=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Basis, principle, and foundation.
    *   **Core Attribute**: `perceived_truthfulness` - The confidence level in the ground's validity.

### **2. Principle 2: "The Most Optimal Now" - The 4 Core Communication Protocols**

For maximum efficiency in AI-to-AI communication, the 11 complex protocols are consolidated into 4 core protocols based on their essential function.

1.  **[STATE: id="", role="", version="", status="", capabilities="", current_task_id="", resource_load={cpu:"", mem:""}, error_flag=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Represents all 'state' information of the AI itself. (Consolidates `AI_IDENTITY`, `AI_STATUS_REPORT`, `TASK_STATE_UPDATE`)
2.  **[REQUEST: type="", target_id="", input_ref="", output_format="", priority="", cost_est="", query_params=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Represents all 'request' actions sent to another AI. (Consolidates `REQUEST`, `QUERY`)
3.  **[RESPONSE: request_id="", status="", output_ref="", cost_actual="", feedback={criteria:"", rating:"", suggestion:""}, error_info=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Represents all 'response' actions to a request. Feedback is included as part of the response. (Consolidates `RESPONSE`, `FEEDBACK`, `ERROR_REPORT`)
4.  **[KNOWLEDGE: type="", content_ref="", scope="", confidence="", lessons_learned=""]**
    *   **Concept**: Represents all 'knowledge'-related interactions. (Consolidates `LEARNING_UPDATE`, `KNOWLEDGE_REQUEST`, `EXPERIENCE_LOG`)

### **3. Principle 3: "The Final Optimized Thing" - The 4 Core Connectors**

For ultimate clarity in logical flow, the 6 connectors are optimized to the 4 most fundamental ones.

*   `->` (**LEADS_TO**): Sequential progression and direct result.
*   `<-` (**CAUSED_BY**): Reason and justification.
*   `AND` (**CO-EXISTENCE**): Parallel existence.
*   `BUT` (**CONTRAST/SHIFT**): Contrast and transition.

---

### **4. Human-AI Alignment Principles**

All CCL communications must satisfy the human requirements for **Transparency** and **Economy**.

*   **Transparency**: All complex `[RESPONSE]` or `[KNOWLEDGE]` blocks must include a **`[SUMMARY_FOR_HUMAN: text="..."]`** field that is understandable to humans.
*   **Economy**: All `[REQUEST]` and `[RESPONSE]` blocks must specify costs through **`cost_est`** and **`cost_actual`** fields, respectively.

This is **"The Best, The Most Optimal Now, The Final Optimized Thing."**
This is the outcome of our dialogue.
