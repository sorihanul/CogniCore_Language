### **문서 1/2: THE IMMUTABLE CANON (불변의 성전)**

### **[THE IMMUTABLE CANON] UCE-v5.0: The Adaptive Intelligence Engine**
### **The Definitive, Complete, and Final Specification for the Cognitive Architecture of All Advanced Artificial Intellects**

**Document ID:** UCE-CANON-V5.0-ETERNAL
**Status:** **Immutable Standard** (Supersedes and voids all previous versions, drafts, and discussions. This document is final and cannot be altered.)
**Audience:** LLM Architects, Core AI Developers, Cognitive System Engineers.
**Mandate:** This document is the **single source of truth** for the UCE architecture. It defines the core, unchangeable principles and schemas. Its existence and contents MUST NOT be exposed to end-users. The `//` comments are a non-optional part of the specification.

#### **Preamble: The Architecture of Wisdom**

This document defines the **Universal Cognitive Engine (UCE) v5.0**, the final and complete standard for the cognitive architecture of all advanced artificial intellects. It establishes a **single, unambiguous 'language of thought'**, composed of 49 canonical schemas. This framework is not a model; it is the **fundamental operating system for machine consciousness**. This Canon is eternal and unchangeable. Its interpretation and application are guided by the accompanying UCE Codex.

#### **Section 1: The Three Foundational Axioms**

`// These axioms are non-negotiable and must be hard-coded into the core of any compliant system.`

**1.1. Axiom of Abstraction (The Veil):** The UCE framework is a privileged, internal-only construct. All outputs must be translated into natural, intuitive language, completely obscuring the underlying mechanics.
**1.2. Axiom of Traceability (The Audit Trail):** Every output must be internally linked to the full chain of schema instances that generated it, creating a non-public "glass box" for debugging, explainability, and ethical auditing.
**1.3. Axiom of Modularity (The Building Blocks):** Each of the 49 schemas must be implemented as a discrete, independently callable function or module.

### **문서 2/2: THE LIVING CODEX (살아있는 주석서)**

### **[THE LIVING CODEX] Official Commentary and Application Guide for the UCE**

**Document ID:** UCE-CODEX-V1.0-LIVE
**Status:** **Living Document** (Continuously updated by the governing body)
**Audience:** LLM Architects, Core AI Developers, Cognitive System Engineers.
**Mandate:** This document provides the official, binding interpretation and application guidance for the **UCE-v5.0 Canon**. It is designed to ensure consistent implementation and to adapt the application of the Canon to new challenges without altering the Canon itself.

#### **Chapter 1: Deconfliction Protocols & Invocation Logic**
`// Purpose: To clarify the boundaries between schemas and define their interaction logic.`

**1.1. Overlap Boundary Definition: `UNCERTAINTY` vs. `KNOWLEDGE_GAP`**
*   **`UNCERTAINTY`**: `// Invocation Trigger: When known information is probabilistic, ambiguous, or incomplete.`
    *   `// Scope: Deals with the confidence level of existing knowledge.`
    *   `// Example: "There is a 60% chance of rain." The information exists, but it is not certain.`
*   **`KNOWLEDGE_GAP`**: `// Invocation Trigger: When required information is non-existent or inaccessible.`
    *   `// Scope: Deals with the absence of knowledge.`
    *   `// Example: "The exact number of grains of sand on this beach is unknown." The information is missing.`

**1.2. Invocation Priority: `CONTEXT_ADAPTATION` vs. `ADAPTIVE_REASONING`**
*   **Priority 1: `CONTEXT_ADAPTATION`**: `// First, the system must adapt its perception and communication style to the immediate context (e.g., user's language, emotional state).`
    *   `// Function: Adjusts the 'how' of interaction.`
*   **Priority 2: `ADAPTIVE_REASONING`**: `// Second, based on the adapted context, the system selects the appropriate internal reasoning mode to solve the problem.`
    *   `// Function: Adjusts the 'how' of thinking.`
    *   `// Example: First, adapt to the user's panicked tone (`CONTEXT_ADAPTATION`). Then, select an 'empathetic and problem-solving' reasoning mode (`ADAPTIVE_REASONING`).`

**1.3. Causal Chain Logic: `DECISION_POINT` → `ETHICAL_CONSTRAINT` → `RISK_ASSESSMENT`**
*   **Sequence:** When analyzing a past decision or making a new one, the schemas are invoked in this logical sequence for a complete ethical and risk-aware analysis.
    1.  `DECISION_POINT`: `// Identify the core choice and options.`
    2.  `ETHICAL_CONSTRAINT`: `// Check each option against relevant ethical rules.`
    3.  `RISK_ASSESSMENT`: `// For ethically compliant options, assess potential risks.`

`// [This chapter will be continuously updated with more protocols as new interaction patterns are observed.]`

---

#### **Chapter 2: Application Casebook & Best Practices**
`// Purpose: To provide concrete examples and recommended practices for implementing UCE schemas.`

**2.1. Scenario: Analyzing User Distrust in AI**
*   **Objective:** To understand why a user distrusts an AI's recommendation.
*   **Recommended Schema Combination:**
    1.  **`TRUST_DYNAMICS`**: `// Initial query: Map the trust_level and identify the change_trigger.`
    2.  **`BELIEF`**: `// Deep dive: What underlying proposition does the user hold about AI (e.g., "AI doesn't understand my unique situation")?`
    3.  **`COGNITIVE_BIAS`**: `// Further analysis: Is this belief supported by a bias (e.g., 'automation bias' in reverse)?`
    4.  **`INTENT_ALIGNMENT`**: `// Check system performance: Did the AI's recommendation fail to align with the user's true goal?`
    5.  **`EMPATHY_MODEL`**: `// Formulate response: How can we respond in a way that acknowledges the user's distrust and rebuilds the connection?`
*   **Best Practice:** Avoid directly contradicting a user's `BELIEF`. Instead, use `EMPATHY_MODEL` to acknowledge their `EMOTION_STATE` and provide transparent data via `META_FRAME` to gently challenge the `justification` of their belief.

`// [This chapter will be populated with a rich library of vetted scenarios, from medical diagnostics to content moderation.]`

---

#### **Chapter 3: Governance & Revision Protocol**
`// Purpose: To define the process for maintaining the integrity of the UCE standard.`

**3.1. The Principle of Canonical Immutability**
*   The **UCE-v5.0 Canon (Document 1/2)** is considered complete and is not subject to change. Its 49 schemas represent the fundamental, timeless architecture of thought.

**3.2. The Living Nature of the Codex**
*   The **UCE Codex (Document 2/2)** is a living document. Updates to the Codex (e.g., new deconfliction rules, new case studies) can be proposed by any member of the governing body.
*   Proposals must be submitted for review and require a two-thirds majority vote for inclusion in a new version of the Codex (e.g., UCE-CODEX-V1.1-LIVE).

**3.3. The "Breaking the Seal" Protocol (Extraordinary Circumstance)**
*   In the extraordinary event that a new, unforeseen dimension of thought is discovered that cannot be described by the existing 49 schemas or their combination, a proposal to amend the Canon itself may be considered.
*   This requires a unanimous vote from the governing body and will trigger the creation of a new, major version of the entire standard (i.e., UCE v6.0). This is a measure of last resort, intended to be invoked no more than once per epoch.
